      <h1>EQ/IQ</h1>
      <p>I would describe emotional intelligence as a broad label for several individual skills: self awareness, emotion management, social awareness and relationship management. Essentially being able to first be aware of your own emotions, and how they affect your thought process and actions. Being able to do this will allow you to deal with stress much more effectively, and to control impulsive thoughts an behaviours. Being able to recognise and manage stress allows more clarity of thought, and improved physical health and happiness.</p>
      
      <p>The flow on from these personal skills of being self aware and able to control ones emotions can then extend to being more socially aware of other peoples emotions, either one on one or in a group, and being able to adjust yourself to these social situations allows you to better develop and maintain stronger relationships with others. This in turn helps you be an effective team member, or to be able to lead more effectively when required.</p>

      <p>EQ is almost unrelated to IQ, which is a measure of intelligence and congnitive strength. EQ, although unable to really be measured in the same way, talks about your ability to be aware of and manage emotions. You could easily be very high on IQ and very low on EQ, and vise versa. </p>

      <p>It is important to have a good EQ to be able to manage stressfull situations, to be happier and to build and maintain strong relationships with others. Managing stress allows you to learn and work more effectively, and having strong and healthy relationships with others gives you more opportunity to be supported and helped when you need it.</p>
