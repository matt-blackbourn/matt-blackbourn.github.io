      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
      <p>When asked to complete this challenge on defining my personal values, I felt immediate resistance. For anyone who knows me, they would (and did) laugh at my misfortune for being asked to do something like that, and would understand how uncomfortable it would be for me. Not necessarily because I am averse to doing it, but because it is not something I have never had any experience in. When I told one friend about this, she couldn't believe that I had no idea where to start, or that I didn't really even understand what my values were - as if it was just second nature for her to know the answers to those kind of self-reflective questions. I was always aware that my behaviour and decisions were driven by what people called values, but I have never been interested in putting a label on myself, or trying to be my own personal psychologist and come up with the underlying reasons for decisions or attitudes. However, completing this challenge was definitely beneficial - although not completely eye opening as to the values I feel I have and those that others describe me as having, but because I gained at least some understanding of what makes me tick. As it turns out, personal growth is at or near the top of my list, and I understand that the most growth occurs when you do something that is hard for you, and that the biggest improvements come not from improving what you are already good at, but improving where you are weakest.</p>
      
      <p>Upon reflecting on my own personal values and receiving feedback from friends and family, it became clear that culture has really shaped me - perhaps not the culture people classically think of, but for me the culture was the military, where I spent the first decade of my adult life. People always asked me how difficult it was for me to become a soldier and to adopt that way of thinking and being, and my honest answer was that I didn't think I had had to change at all, and that my personality was a great fit for the Army right from the start. Only recently have I started to realise that the older I get, and the longer I am out of that environment, the more obvious it is that I have some underlying values that had been masked or buried, either by choice or by necessity, by my time in the military. Before discussing that, a brief explanations of my core personal values:</p>
      
      <p>Growth/challenge/mastery/continuous improvement: The times when I have been happiest and most fulfilled in life are when I have been embodying these values. Achieving (or more accurately, pursuing) mastery opens up a level of wisdom and insight that was previously unattainable; a kind of fruit that is a result of persistence and hard work, and encountering challenges and working through them over time. I have been lucky enough to experience this in a couple of areas in life, and enjoy the feeling. Further, I seem to seek out and enjoy those things that are perceived to be either too hard, or that not many people choose to do. Examples are my two careers, first as a bomb disposal operator, and then as a skydiving instructor. But also this trait emerges in my day to day life, where I am constantly trying to learn and improve myself. An example of this is learning foreign languages - after learning Dutch, I wanted to try something else, and was on the fence for a long time between trying German, or Mandarin. I debated for months, and in the end, decided on German. However, on the first day I realised that it was very similar to Dutch, and it felt quite easy. That was extremely unsatisfying to me, and I immediately lost interest in it, which surprised me because I had been very enthusiastic about it, and even have some German friends. Instead, I decided to try Mandarin, and the sheer difficulty of it captivated me and drove me to continue. I find the same with coding and programming - I find it just as difficult as every other person, but for some reason the very fact that it is so hard makes me want to do it. On reflection, I think this comes from a deeper understanding that the harder something is to do, the more inherent value that thing has.</p>
      
      <p>Other values high on my list are efficiency/simplicity/dependability/trustworthiness/honesty. These all seem to play into each other in a way, although they may seem like they are unrelated. For example, I have been told that I am often too honest, and I don't disagree with that. But when faced with being honest or dishonest, honesty is always more simple and creates more dependable relationships. I view myself has being extremely dependable and trustworthy, and expect that from others - the minute there is a lack of trust whether actual or perceived, there is a breakdown in that relationship. I also embody efficiency and simplicity in my lifestyle - I tend to wear the same simple and comfortable clothes day in and day out, and would rather they be functional and economical than trendy. I eat the same foods day in day out, and would rather they be nutritional and easy/time efficient to prepare than tasty.</p>
      
      <p>An interesting situation arose yesterday involving some friends. We were set to host a pot luck dinner, and it was organised by one of our friends who had invited all the usual people in our circle of friends, but not one couple. This was due to a falling out that had occurred within the group, and not wanting to step on any toes, this couple had been left off the list. I didn't realise until a day or two later, when I noticed they weren't included in the group chat.</p>
      
      <p>I was surprised by this, and immediately had the feeling that they should be invited. On the one hand, I had not organised the dinner nor invited any of the people to it. This meant that it almost wasn't my place to invite them. On the other hand, it was my house that the dinner was being hosted at, and so I felt some responsibility even though it hadn't been my decision to leave them off the guest list in the first place.</p>
      <p>It was a very delicate situation, because my two choices were to invite them, or not to. Inviting them meant stepping on the toes of the organiser, potentially (likely) revealing to this couple that they had been purposely left out, and causing damage to that particular friendship. Not inviting them meant I was an active participant (now that I was aware of it) in purposely excluding someone and hoping they wouldn't find out. For me, this seems extremely dishonest and acting that way is not something I would want my friends to do to me. So in the end, I decided that honesty was the way to go, despite the fact that I knew the consequences it might have with individuals within the group; between the uninvited couple and the original organiser, and between myself and the organiser for taking matters into my own hands. </p>
      <p>Until that happened, I would not really have rated compassion highly on a list of potential values that drove my decisions, and this came as a bit of a surprise. Normally, I would rate myself as the last person in that group to notice someone had been left out, and to feel bad enough about it to act on it, but this time it was me. I actually feel quite proud of that decision, despite the consequences, as it represents personal growth in an area I have been historically weak in, as shown by the feedback from friends. </p>
      
      <p>It really goes to show me that we are not fixed as people, and that we may have deeper, underlying values which have been masked due to culture, or circumstance. In my case, I think my background in the military forced values like empathy and compassion into the background, and enhanced values such as efficiency, dependability and trustworthiness. It is also the likely source of some of my biggest limitations: I can at times be inflexible and unable to empathise with someone else's point of view, especially when their decision making is a result of a completely different set of values to mine. This is bred in the military culture to some extent, because it is an environment where only those with the same values survive and thrive, and therefore you are surrounded by people in your work and personal life that mirror your values, and as a result don't get much exposure to other ways of being. Further, everything that is done in the military and every value that is cultivated is done for a very specific reason, and that is to increase the chances of survival in some way. This is powerful reasoning, and hard to argue with - the only issue is that outside of that world, the same attitudes don't hold up quite as well once the overriding concern of survival and that very specific environment is taken away.</p>
      
      <p>In terms of my learning and career development, I am definitely aided by my natural strengths of striving for constant growth and improvement, and of wanting to feel challenged - indeed, the knowledge and experience I have knowing that the more challenging something is, the more valuable the fruit will be, will be essential in getting me through the hardest times. Working against me is my inflexibility with others, as this often causes me to limit my circle of close peers, which then works against me becasue it further strengthens that inflexibility by not being exposed to many conflicting values. Also it is often those people with a completely different approach that can compliment my own the most effectively, and the value of both added is greater than either on its own. </p>
