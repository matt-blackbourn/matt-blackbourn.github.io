      <h3>Blocked!</h3>
      <p>
         During the last few days, I have been solving the JavaScript Kata challenges. At one point, I reached a complete block - I didn't have any idea how to proceed, thought I had tried everything I knew of, and had no idea what I didn't know, and therefore no idea what to look for! I was convinced that my logic was correct, that I had the right process, and yet, the tests were failing. I had tried google, console logging, reading error messages, and trying things even when I thought they wouldn't work - only to be proven right!
      </p>
      <p>
         In order to get past this block, I reached out to a fellow student who I knew was at around the same point as I was. It was as simple as asking him whether he had had any issues at the same point I had, and he had. He mentioned that when he was at the same point, he had trouble understanding the example answers that were given. Example answers? I hadn't even seen them! It was the worlds fastest solution to a problem that had stopped me for at least half an hour, resulting in a lot of frustration. It turns out, I had used a bracket where I should have used a dot, and the code worked immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
         The problem was just a lack of understanding of how to use dot and bracket notation, and once this was understood, the problem was much easier. I learnt that even just talking to someone about your problem can give you a fresh perspective that you never thought of (like checking to see if there were any example answers!). Althought I felt frustrated for most of the process, the satisfaction at the end of it when I realised my code was almost correct and I hadn't made any massive errors in how I solved the problem made up for it.

      <h3>An elegant solution...</h3>
      <p>
         During the first part of the Kata challenges, there was a challenge to create some objects, one for each person. Instead of creating them manually one by one, I used a loop to automatically create them for me. The next question asked for changes to be made to those objects. This time, I couldn't think of how to structure the code to do it automatically, and so I made the changes manually. Afterwards, on looking back at the code, I realise the method was exactly the same as how I had solved the first challenge, and so I rewrote it, this time using a loop like the first time. Once again, I looked back at the code and realised I could make it even more simple, but putting the second questions logic inside the loop from the first question. It ended up meaning that the second challenge was completed with a single line of code, which I found quite elegant.
      </p>
      <p>
         Throughout the process, I felt like there was something I was missing, like I had the ability to solve it in a better way, but just couldn't see how. It wasn't until I wrote it all out verbosely that I saw the connection - not once, but twice. I have to admit, it felt pretty good when I came to the final solution, and I learned that reflecting back on what I had done was the reason I was able to unlock those blocks in my brain and see the answer I knew was there the whole time.
      </p>

      <h3>Tecchniques</h3>
     <p>
        Throughout the sprint, I used a variety of problem solving techniques. I found that I rely heavily on console.logging, and do this at nearly every stage of the problem to make sure what I'm writing is working the way I imagined it to. I also use pseudo code at the beginning of every problem, and find it helpful to get my ideas written down so it gives me an "instruction sheet" to follow.
     </p>
     <p>
        Often I need to look things up on google - and have found a lot of help from stack overflow, and from youtube when it comes to learning different methods and concepts and just get my head around things in general. I've also asked peers for help, as described above, and used reflection to improve my solutions and not make simple mistakes a second or third time. Over all, I feel pretty confident with most of these techniques, and also something else that I have started to do, and that is to give myself some time to digest the problem before I start to solve it. This technique is simple, and all it involves is just reading and digesting the problem, and then going away from the screen, and just thinking quietly to myself about how best to go about the solution. Often just changing my environment and taking the time to let the problem sink in lets me think more clearly and without worrying that the problem is too hard or that initially I have no idea how to solve it.
