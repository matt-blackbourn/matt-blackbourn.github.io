      <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
      <p>My long term goal is to be a developer with enough experience and skill to be sought after, and to be able to effectively lead development teams. In order to do that, while I am at dev academy the main thing I would like to learn is how to collaborate well with others who come from a vaiety of backgrounds and bring a variety of different qualities, in a development setting. A limitation I currently have is that I can sometimes be quick to judge other people and be critical of their approach to doing things, especially when it is radically different from my own way of thinking/doing things, so I would like to improve this. It is much better to be able to see the value of the skills they bring and use their differnt approaches to compliment mine, and to be able to see how I can incorportate aspects of their thinking into my own and learn from them.</p>
      
      <p>A strength I have is to be able to be completely single minded and focussed on what I'm doing, but due to the high workload and the fact that I have no outside commitments during the course, I think my biggest obstacle will be a likelyhood of becoming burnt. I often drive myself to hard for too long instead of pacing myself, and don't realise I'm tired until its too late. To combat this I will ensure I stick to a discipline of taking regular breaks often throughout the day, with the pomodoro timer, and will try to establish this habit throughout foundations. Also I will try to make sure I take time off in the weekends and evenings to ensure I can clear my mind and get good rest/sleep.  </p>

      <p>At times on the course it is likely I will need help. My natural tendency is to battle away by myself, but I know this is the less efficient solution - better is to take advantage of the other students around me who might be able to help, or ask a facilitator. My expectation that they will understand where I am at in the learning process, and be able to taylor the work to fit my individual learning needs. This may be noticing that I have some deficiencies in foundational skills which need to be revisited or worked on before moving forward, or to be able to move me on to more challenging things while still remaining in the learning zone. It might also be to recognise that I am getting too far ahead of myself or putting excess time into something that is making the learning process more difficult or longer than it needs to be.</p>
