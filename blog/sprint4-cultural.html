      <h3>Neuroplastcitiy</h3>
      <p>Neuroplasticity is the ablility of the brain to be able to change over time. It was once thought that the brain was fixed in state, and that what you were born with is what you have. Now science has shown that the brain can continue to grow and change in response to stimulus over time, even into old age. This is a powerful thing, and studies have also shown that just being aware of the concept of neuroplasiticiy is enough for people to be able to show an increased rate of learning. This is an example of having a limitting belief which can halt progress in everything else that you do in life - which makes learning about neuroplasticity extremely powerful.</p>
      <p>In order to benefit from neuroplasticity, it is important to constantly challenge the brain to learn new things. Prior to dev academy, I tried to do this through learning foriegn languages and other skill based things like juggling, trading and playing poker, in order to stimulate neural circuits that were unused in my brain. Now being at dev academy has replaced all of that, becasue I am learning new languages, and new skills constantly. Another important aspect of neuroplasiticiy is repetition - new neural networks need to be constantly used by practicing new skills in order for the strength of the networks to grow. At some point, the networks are so strong that the skill becomes subconcious, and the execution of that skill is taken care of by another part of the brain and allows you to execute with far less mental effort. That frees up the brain to be able to learn new things.</p>
      <p>One of the key ways to increase the effects of neuroplasticity is to practice mindfulness. This is because a large number of the thoughts we have each day are beyond our consciousness, and a lot of the decisions we make are based on habits, and not always good habits. By being mindful and increasing self awareness, we can be more able to be aware of these thoughts that drive our behaviour, and therefore be able to make different choices and decisions in order to strengthen the neural pathways we want to strengthen, instead of the ones we don't.  </p>
      <p>Another key part of increasing neuroplasticity is repetition. In order to become strong, a neural network needs to be accessed and used over and over again. Slightly changing the context or environment of the practice or increasing the difficulty slightly can speed up the process, because other neural networks associated to the primary ones get stimulated as well, further strengthening the complete network. Repetition ensures that the changes become permanent, so that the skill or habit you are learning can be executed without thinking.</p>

      <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
      <p>The growth mindset is a way of viewing yourself in way that you believe you can change your brain and learn new things, regardless of who you are or what you are naturally good or bad at. This is contrasted by a fixed mindset, where you believe that the skills, ablitities and personality you have now is the one you will have for the rest of your life. It is relevant to everybody, but even more important to those trying to learn a new skill, like those of us at dev academy. If we had a fixed mindset, then we are immediately imposing a block on ourselves, because deep down we may not think we can learn to code. This will cause us to give up when things get hard, because at that point the logical conclusion is that if we cant do it now, we will never be able to do it. Having a growth mindset in this scenario would me we view something that is hard as a challenge and a chance to grow, and we know that deep down if we work hard enough for long enough, one day we will be able to do the thing we are trying to do.</p>
      <p>An article I found interesting talks about how the way a teacher speaks to students can influence their mindset to be fixed or not (<a href="https://athlosacademies.org/growth-mindset/">click here</a>). In this article, Carol Dweck, a leading researcher in this area says that giving children (or learners in general) compliments based on their intelligence, like "You're a natural!" or "You are so smart!" actually encourages a fixed mindset, because the learner will naturally seek this praise in the future. If they are trying to seek praise for being intelligent, then they will avoid situations where they might make mistakes or be wrong, or look stupid. Therefore, they will end up shying away from challenges, fear failure and therefore lose the biggest opportunities they have to learn. A better solution is to praise the process they are using, and to remind them that mistakes help them learn. When a student can take pride in their own ability to work hard and solve a problem, they no longer need praise in the traditional sense, and will actively seek opportunities to challenge themselves and grow. </p>
      <p>I will continue to integrate a growth mindset into my learning and life through being aware of any negative thoughts that arise during struggles or challenges, and instead use them as opportunities to learn and grow. At times when I cannot do something immediately I slip into a fixed mindset, and wonder how other people can do that thing I'm trying to do. However, the more this happens, and the more times I work hard and achieve what I set out to achive, the more it re-inforces the growth mindset and neuroplasticity.</p>
