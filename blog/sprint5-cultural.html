      <h3>Personal learnings</h3>
      <p>
         Throughout the foundations course work, there have been several things I have learnt about myself as a result of the core learning. One is that at times I slip into a fixed mindset when I encounter a problem. When I see a problem that I have never solved before, or see someone else’s solution to a problem, I sometimes catch myself thinking something like “I obviously just can’t think in that way”, which is a very fixed way of thinking about the situation. I now have to constantly remind myself that the way I think about things can be changed over time, and that the more exposure I get to something and the more practice I do, the more obvious better solutions will become. Another thing I learned is that when I encounter a difficult problem that I don’t really know how to solve immediately, I can make very fast progress by first stopping for a while and thinking about it, and then solving a very small part of the problem and building on that. It gives me good momentum and confidence to solve something small and to make a start, and the rest ends up taking care of itself in most cases.
      </p>
      <h3>Values, empathy, self-awareness</h3>
      <p>
         Part of the core learning was focussed on values, empathy and self awareness. The role that these play in programming and learning is quite big. For example, being self aware lets you see the result that your emotions might be having on the way you are thinking about a problem, or how you are relating to someone else. In programming, you are often working with other people, and so being able to have empathy for how those other people are feeling, and why they are thinking the way they are is essential to be able to work as part of a productive team. Knowing your core values, strengths and weaknesses allows you to identify areas where you could be taking responsibility within the team, and areas where you could look to be supported by someone who compliments your personality. Of course, whenever there is a need to take a leadership role, all these EQ skills become more important because your thoughts and actions will have a much larger effect on those around you who are looking for guidance and support. If you don’t have self awareness and empathy in those situations, you can risk damaging or destroying the relationships which allow your team to be a cohesive unit, and instead end up with a group of individuals.
      </p>
      <h3>Suprise!</h3>
      <p>
         What has surprised me the most about the core learning is the emphasis that is being put on mindfulness. I have been practicing meditation for some years now, and it is interesting to me that this skill is now becoming main stream enough to be included in formal education. I’m glad to hear that the syllabus includes meditation and other mindfulness training like active listening and journalling, because I believe that these things are beneficial, even if I struggle to articulate exactly why or how they improve your mind.
      </p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
         The most challenging aspects of the core learning for me were probably trying to determine my core values. It isn’t something I’ve really spent any time doing before, and trying to articulate exactly what values I place the highest priority on was difficult for me. In the end, I realised that growth had to be at number one, as the times in my life when I have been most content are in situations where I am being challenged, and in which there is plenty of opportunity to improve myself and opportunity to aggressively pursue that growth. Conversely, the times I have been unhappiest are when the opportunity for growth is taken away or limited, and any effort to move forward is blocked in some way.
      </p>
      <h3>Why focus on this?</h3>
      <p>
         I think there are many reasons for a programming school to be focussing so much on these core development skills, but probably most important is that these skills are required for someone to work well as part of a team. In an industry that may attract less socially able people, there is a higher risk of employees having a high degree of technical competence, and yet be unable to fit into and work as part of a team, rendering any skill they have to be useless. My guess is that over the years, the tech industry as a whole has learned the hard way that a group of talented and skilled individuals who can’t work together is far inferior to a team of less technically skilled people working in harmony to achieve a single goal.
      </p>
      <h3>Worth it?</h3>
      <p>
         In conclusion, I don’t feel like the time spent on learning core skills was a waste of time. For all the reasons mentioned above, they are important skills to have, and because practicing them is uncomfortable for a lot of people (myself included), they are the skills that need to be actively practiced. In contrast, technical skills will naturally build over time without really paying too much attention to them, as they are practiced daily anyway, and the feedback loop is constantly being used - ie, if something doesn’t work, the code tells, you! If you write something that is hard to understand, the code tells you! But with the EQ skills, it is not always obvious something is wrong, and maybe you have deficiencies you are not even aware you have - if this is the case, you can’t fix a problem you don’t know about! So learning about the core skills is a critical part of any developers learning journey and career.

      <h2>Look forward to Bootcamp..</h2>
      <h3>Long term goal and career path</h3>
      <p>
         I hope to use the skills I gain at EDA to initially find a job as a junior developer, in order to have the most chance to develop my skills as quickly as possible. I would like to work in a company that supports the growth and continual development of its employees, and where I can find strong mentors to learn from. Long term, I would like to be in a position where I can help to mentor other developers, and to manage development teams.
      </p>
      <h3>Strengths and weaknesses during bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
         I think my biggest strength will be my desire learning, and a constant need to improve myself/evolve. I have experience with coaching and mentoring already, and I feel like this is a strength I will be able to use in group or pairing situations with other students. A weakness I have is that I am prone to burning out because of pressure I put on myself to excel, which can result in periods of time when I am unproductive and unmotivated to do things that are difficult for me. With the workload likely to be heavy during bootcamp, I will need to take extra care to have days off and factor in relaxation time, even when it feels to me like I am being lazy.
      </p>
      <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge</h3>
      <p>
         I think the biggest non-technical challenge I will face is being able to maintain the motivation required to make it through the full 9 weeks of heavy workload, especially when doing things I don’t see immediate value in, or that aren’t enjoyable for me. I have no issue with motivation when I am learning something I want to learn, but it is inevitable that I will be forced to do and learn things I feel like rejecting, and in that case my motivation to produce high quality work could drop.
      </p>
      <h3>Human skills to be developed</h3>
      <p>
         I would really like to see my ability to empathise with others improve, especially those with radically different values and ways of thinking than me. I am aware that at times I can be closed to other opinions that don’t fit with mine, and different ways of thinking or solving problems that I might dismiss as inefficient or less optimal. I would like to improve my habit of being too quick to judge these types of people and what they bring to the situation that is different to me, and instead use those times as opportunities to be exposed to a different way of thinking that can enhance the way I do things.
      </p>
      <h3>My expectations</h3>
      <p>
         My only real expectation of myself is that I do the best I am capable of. It goes without saying that if I encounter a problem I need to bring it up with those around me, whether it be with other students, with teachers, or with friends and family. I expect that throughout the course I will maintain my meditation practice and also to fit exercise in whenever I can, as well as rest and relaxation time every week in order to manage stress and make sure I can be as productive as possible. I also expect that I will treat others on the course and in facilitation roles with respect at all times, especially at times when everyone is under a lot of pressure, and to understand that at those times I need to give myself and others more leeway.
